# AlexandriaBase

This is the first open source part of the Alexandria
software package. Alexandria is a software for the
use of small archives (or museums) that want to
catalogue their digitalized material in an easy to use way
and that can be done also by people that are not
archivists by training.

The system has been developed for the Archiv Soziale
Bewegungen in Freiburg im Breisgau, Germany. It has
been in use for more than a decade. This is a complete
rewrite of the software according to better standards
and with the aim to keep things that are specific for
the Archiv Soziale Bewegungen separated from the core
of the software, so other archives may use it too.

This is just the base module with common functionality,
more modules will follow.
